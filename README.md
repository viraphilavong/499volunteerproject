Church Volunteer Registration

This final iteration does not use the second branch "database." We use Google forms to create our form. It offers a visual interpretation which the church had lacked before.

The output of the form is the following.

1. Word document
2. PDF file
3. Spreadsheet that gets updated after every submission
4. An email containing all fields filled in the form.
